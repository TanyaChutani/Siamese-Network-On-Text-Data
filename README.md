## Data 
Quora Question Pair Similarity

## Model
This is a natural language processing problem wherein we classify the question pairs as having similar intent or not.
- Developed a Siamese network, in this let the embeddings of two questions be passed through the same model. 
- check the distance measure using cosine similarity and apply sigmoid at the end to get an output. 
- For embeddings, Word2Vec embeddings have been used.
